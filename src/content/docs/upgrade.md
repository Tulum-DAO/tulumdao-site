The harness is under active development. This doc covers
the safe way to pick up new code without killing your running agents or losing
what they remember.

## Why this is safe at all

Your seats' state lives in the **data dir** (`[data] dir` in `orchestra.toml`,
default `~/.orchestra`), completely separate from the **checkout** (the git
clone you're pulling into): `registry.json`, `state/` (sqlite, sessions, the
gateway token), `logs/`, `queue/`. Pulling new code into the checkout never
touches the data dir directly — a code change only affects a running seat once
something restarts and reads the new code. See [docs/INSTALL.md](/docs/install/)'s "Where
things live" section for the full split.

That means the actual risk isn't "losing" a seat — the registry entry and its
memory directory survive a `git pull` untouched. The risk is a **contract
change**: new code that reads or writes `registry.json`, `msg_store.py`'s
schema, or the approvals tables in an incompatible way, running against state
written by the old code. [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](/docs/architecture/)'s Invariants section names
the contracts other things depend on — check changes there specifically.

## `orchestra upgrade`

One command, run from inside your orchestraos checkout (`cd orchestraos`), like
every command on this page:

```bash
orchestra upgrade              # fetch, show what's coming, pull --ff-only, init --yes, doctor
orchestra upgrade --dry-run    # only the "what's coming" part
```

What it does, in order:

1. `git fetch origin`, then prints the incoming commits (`git log HEAD..@{u}`) and flags
   any **contract-bearing paths** in the diff — `scripts/lineage_daemon/`, `msg_store.py`,
   `scripts/approval*.py` — the ones running components trust not to change shape.
   `--dry-run` stops here.
2. Refuses if the checkout has uncommitted changes to tracked files (exit 2) — a
   fast-forward would fail anyway, and you should know why.
3. `git pull --ff-only` (exit 1 with the git message if the branch diverged).
4. `orchestra init --yes`: idempotent — `orchestra.toml` and the data dir are kept, the
   Claude Code hook rows are re-written against the new checkout path, venv and npm
   refresh, and the API and dashboard are rebuilt when any of their source is newer than
   the last build (`--no-venv` / `--no-npm` / `--no-build` are passed through).
5. `orchestra doctor`; its exit code is the command's.

Then restart, so the running services use the new code:

```bash
orchestra down && orchestra up --detach
```

**If you upgraded between #208 and #218 (2026-10-08):** back then `init` did not rebuild an
existing API build, so your API may still lack the web terminal origin check from #208.
Run `orchestra upgrade` once more (or `rm -rf api/dist && orchestra init --yes`, which removes only the API's build output inside
your checkout; `init` rebuilds it straight away), then the
restart above. From #218 on, a plain upgrade rebuilds correctly.

`orchestra upgrade` never restarts anything itself. Spawned seats keep the code they were
spawned with until their next spawn or rotation.

## Doing it by hand

The same sequence, step by step:

```bash
git fetch origin
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main
```

Read the list. Anything touching `scripts/lineage_daemon/`, `msg_store.py`, or
`scripts/approval*.py` — read that commit's message before merging; those are
the paths other running components trust not to change shape underneath them.

```bash
git pull
orchestra init --yes    # idempotent: re-runs npm/venv steps and rebuilds what changed, never
                         # touches orchestra.toml or the data dir; --yes re-writes the
                         # same hook rows without the prompt
orchestra doctor         # confirm every row is still OK
```

If `orchestra doctor` is still green, the checkout is upgraded and nothing
running was disturbed. To actually pick up the new code in a live process:

```bash
orchestra down && orchestra up --detach   # restarts gateway/api/dashboard/beats
```

Spawned seats (tmux sessions like `hello`) are **not** part of the supervisor
and are not touched by `orchestra down`/`up` — they keep running the CLI
session they were spawned with. A seat only picks up harness-side code changes
(a changed `spawn-agent.sh`, a changed rotation beat behavior) the next time
it's respawned or rotated. If a change specifically requires every seat to
restart (rare — the commit message should say so), rotate each one by hand
([docs/GATE.md](https://github.com/Tulum-DAO/orchestraos/blob/ebdb932d138018cc5cfb2d8eda369b22fba12a8d/docs/GATE.md) step 6) rather than killing panes directly.

## If something breaks after upgrading

`orchestra doctor` is the first check, same as always — a broken row after a
pull almost always points at the exact file that changed shape. If a spawned
seat starts behaving strangely after a harness change, check
`<data>/logs/` for the relevant beat before assuming the seat itself is at
fault; the beats (router, rotation, approval_resume) are what most contract
changes actually land in.
