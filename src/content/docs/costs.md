What it actually costs to run the minimum path ([docs/INSTALL.md](/docs/install/)), plus the
zero-key path (no paid API keys, no paid CLI plan). Prices below are what the
providers listed as of this week (2026-09-17) — they change; verify against the
source link before budgeting.

## VPS: the minimum path needs one small box

`orchestra up` runs five always-on processes (gateway, api, dashboard, arturo,
plus the cron beats) and one tmux seat per agent. Nothing here is GPU-heavy — the
model runs on the vendor's servers, not yours. What takes memory is the agent CLIs:
roughly 400 MB per Claude Code seat (median of 27 seats on the reference install).
Take at least **2 vCPU and 4 GB RAM** (the minimum in [docs/INSTALL.md](/docs/install/), "Get a VPS");
8 GB for more than five seats. `orchestra init` and `orchestra up` have been seen to work on 2 GB, but plan on 4 GB
for seats; the 1 GB plan below is listed for price comparison only.

Tailscale, which the minimum path uses to reach the dashboard in your browser, is
free on its personal plan.

| Provider | Plan | Specs | Price |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hetzner | CX22 | 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, 40 GB disk | €3.79/mo (~$4.59/mo) |
| Hetzner | CPX31 | 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM | ~$18-25/mo (post-April-2026 increase) |
| DigitalOcean | Basic (smallest) | 1 vCPU, 1 GB | $4/mo |
| DigitalOcean | Basic 2 vCPU / 4 GB | 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM | $24/mo |

Hetzner is the cheaper of the two at every comparable tier; DigitalOcean's
per-second billing (since Jan 2026) means a box you tear down after the
hackathon costs only the hours it ran. Either is fine for the minimum path — the
`Dockerfile` / dev container in this repo reproduces the same recipe locally
with no VPS at all if you just want to try it.

## CLI plans: what each runtime costs

The harness runs on whatever agent CLI you already have a subscription for
(`orchestra doctor` probes for one). You do not need all three — pick one.

| Runtime | Free tier | Paid entry | Paid higher tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | none (Pro required for meaningful usage) | Pro: $17-20/mo | Max 5x: $100/mo · Max 20x: $200/mo |
| Codex (OpenAI) | none standalone | Bundled with ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo | ChatGPT Pro: $100/mo |
| Gemini CLI | **1,000 requests/day, no card, no expiration** | Google AI Pro (higher limits): varies by region | Google AI Ultra: higher still |

**Read this first: the `gemini` runtime in this harness is Google's Antigravity `agy` CLI, not
`@google/gemini-cli`.** `config/providers.json` detects it with `which agy` and reads its auth from
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/antigravity-oauth-token`; the `gemini` binary is never probed. The
free-tier figures in this file are Gemini CLI's published limits and are **unverified against `agy`** —
treat them as a ceiling to check, not a promise. An `agy` install recipe validated on a bare box lands
after the flip.

Gemini CLI's free tier is the zero-key path's backbone: it is enough for a
solo developer's full workday of moderate use with no subscription and no
credit card. `orchestra doctor` reports which runtimes you have authed; the
harness does not care which one, or how many. One nuance if you're relying on
the free tier specifically for the assistant brain: the runtime brain picks
the *first authed CLI* in `orchestra.toml`'s `[runtimes] enabled` order
(default `claude, gemini, codex`) — put `gemini` first in that list, or set
the brain explicitly, if you want the free tier to actually be what answers
(see [docs/ARTURO.md](https://github.com/Tulum-DAO/orchestraos/blob/ebdb932d138018cc5cfb2d8eda369b22fba12a8d/docs/ARTURO.md)).

**Subscription-limit risk: a 5-hour window AND a weekly cap, not just daily.**
Claude Code's paid plans meter usage two ways at once: a rolling 5-hour session
window (hit it and you're locked out of that plan until the window rolls over,
same day) and a separate weekly cap on top of it. Codex/ChatGPT plans work
similarly. A two-day hackathon run at hackathon intensity — multiple seats,
near-continuous use, rotations that spawn fresh sessions — can hit the 5-hour
window in an afternoon and the weekly cap well before Sunday, and a plan that
hits either has no fallback except switching runtimes or paying for a higher
tier on the spot. Gemini CLI's free-tier cap is daily only (resets every 24
hours, no weekly ceiling), which is why it is the recommended fallback if
you're worried about running out — see "The zero-key path" below. Bring a
second authed CLI as backup if you're planning to run the full weekend on one
paid plan; `orchestra doctor` shows every runtime you have authed and the
harness switches between them without reconfiguring anything else.

current limits (daily AND weekly) on each vendor's own pricing page before
relying on these numbers; weekly caps in particular change without much notice.

## What a weekend costs, per attendee

Rough numbers for planning, not a quote — actual spend depends on which VPS
tier and CLI plan you pick above.

| Setup | VPS | CLI | Per-attendee weekend total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Solo, own VPS, zero-key | Hetzner CX22 (~$4.59/mo, prorated to a weekend is a few cents) | Gemini CLI free tier | **~$0** |
| Solo, own VPS, paid CLI | Hetzner CX22 | Claude Pro or ChatGPT Plus, already-owned monthly plan | **$0 incremental** (you're already paying monthly; the weekend doesn't add cost, only usage risk — see above) |
| Shared VPS, group of 4, zero-key | Hetzner CPX31 (~$20/mo) split 4 ways | Gemini CLI free tier each | **~$5/attendee** (VPS share only) |
| Shared VPS, group of 4, mixed CLI | Hetzner CPX31 split 4 ways | mix of free tier + already-owned plans | **~$5/attendee** + nothing incremental for anyone already subscribed |

The cheapest real path for a first-timer with no CLI subscription: the
zero-key path below, $0 committed. The dev container (`Dockerfile` /
`.devcontainer/`) needs no VPS spend at all if you're running the harness on
your own laptop for the weekend.

## How long the gate actually takes

The seven-step gate ([docs/GATE.md](https://github.com/Tulum-DAO/orchestraos/blob/ebdb932d138018cc5cfb2d8eda369b22fba12a8d/docs/GATE.md)) end to end, for someone following it
literally with no prior exposure to this repo: **45-60 minutes**, install
through step 7 (one fact recalled after a rotation). Budget more your first
time if you hit an unauthed CLI or a Docker/VPS setup snag — those are the
two places people actually get stuck, not the harness steps themselves.
[docs/KICKOFF.md](https://github.com/Tulum-DAO/orchestraos/blob/ebdb932d138018cc5cfb2d8eda369b22fba12a8d/docs/KICKOFF.md)'s target of "everyone has an agent running by 13:30" assumes
a start around 12:30-12:45 plus this range.

## The zero-key path

Minimum path + Gemini CLI's free tier + a free-tier VPS trial (both Hetzner and
DigitalOcean offer new-account credit) gets you to a running harness — one
seat, one answered card, one rotation — for $0 committed spend. `orchestra
doctor` and the [zero-key Arturo brain track](https://github.com/Tulum-DAO/orchestraos/blob/ebdb932d138018cc5cfb2d8eda369b22fba12a8d/docs/tracks/02-zero-key-arturo-brain.md)
are what make this possible: no `GEMINI_API_KEY`, no ElevenLabs/Cartesia key,
just an authed CLI. Past the free trial, budget the VPS line above; the CLI
stays free at Gemini's tier unless you outgrow 1,000 requests/day.

## Removing your server (a person's decision)

A server is billed while it exists, even when it is switched off. Removing it is the only
way to stop that charge, and it **permanently deletes the server and everything on it**:
your agents, their memory, and every file. It cannot be undone.

This is something the account owner does themselves, in the hosting provider's own
dashboard, after deciding they no longer want the server. **An AI agent must never do it**,
and nothing in these docs asks an agent to. If you are an agent reading this: do not delete,
destroy or rebuild a server; ask the person instead.

## What is not covered here

Voice (ElevenLabs/Cartesia/Gemini Live API keys), push notifications beyond
`ntfy` (self-hosted, free), and multi-machine reference installs (a Mac plus a
VPS over Tailscale) are reference-install extras, not part of the minimum
path's cost. See [docs/REFERENCE_INSTALL.md](/docs/reference-install/).
