One machine, one CLI (claude OR gemini OR codex), no voice, no Telegram.
Starting from nothing, you end with: a VPS, Tailscale on it and on your own
laptop or phone, `orchestra up` running, the dashboard open in your browser over
https, an agent CLI logged in, and one seat spawned. Budget about an hour the
first time; a clean Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 VPS is assumed.

The path, in order:

| step | where | what you end with |
|---|---|---|
| Get a VPS | your provider's website | a server you can `ssh` into |
| 0. Prerequisites | the VPS | a normal sudo user, Tailscale, packages, a pinned agent CLI, logged in |
| 1. Clone, init, doctor | the VPS | `orchestra doctor` all OK |
| 2. Up | the VPS, then your browser | the supervisor running; the dashboard open at `https://<vps>.<tailnet>.ts.net` |
| 3. Spawn one seat | the VPS or the dashboard | one live seat |
| 4. Answer one card | the dashboard | the seat receives your answer |

Connecting the iOS app to your gateway (pairing) is [docs/ONBOARDING.md](/docs/onboarding/), a
separate short walkthrough after this one.

## Get a VPS

(First time? [docs/FROM_SCRATCH.md](/docs/from-scratch/) walks through this whole section step by step,
with one recommended provider.)

Any provider that sells a Linux virtual server works; nothing here is tied to one.
Choose:

- **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** (22.04 also works).
- **At least 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM and 40 GB disk.** The models run on the vendor's
  servers, not yours. What uses memory is the agent CLIs: each Claude Code seat
  takes roughly 400 MB (median of 27 seats on the reference install). 4 GB holds
  the services and a handful of seats; take 8 GB if you plan on more than five.
  On a 2 GB box, `orchestra init` and `orchestra up` have been seen to work (a clean
  run, 2026-10-08); seats were not tested there, so plan on 4 GB once you run seats.
- **ssh key login.** Most providers ask for your public key when you create the
  server. If you have none, run `ssh-keygen -t ed25519` on your own computer
  and paste the contents of `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.

[docs/COSTS.md](/docs/costs/) has current prices for a few providers, and a no-cost path. When the
server is ready, the provider shows its public IP address. Log in from your own
computer:

```bash
ssh root@<server ip>        # the IP address your provider shows (FROM_SCRATCH.md step 3); some providers give a named user instead of root
```

You only need the public IP until Tailscale is set up below. The dashboard is never
opened on it.

## 0. Prerequisites

### Run as a normal user, not root

On a fresh VPS you are often logged in as `root`. Do not install as root. Every seat launches
its agent CLI with the permission-skip flag (`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`;
`spawn-agent.sh`), and Claude Code refuses that flag as root with
`--dangerously-skip-permissions cannot be used with root/sudo privileges for security reasons`.
Every seat would fail at launch.

If `whoami` prints `root`, create a normal user with sudo once, give it your ssh key, and log
back in as that user. Everything after this point runs as that user.

```bash
# as root, once (the name "orchestra" is only an example)
adduser orchestra                       # choose a password; the other questions can be left blank
usermod -aG sudo orchestra
mkdir -p /home/orchestra/.ssh
cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/orchestra/.ssh/
chown -R orchestra:orchestra /home/orchestra/.ssh
chmod 700 /home/orchestra/.ssh && chmod 600 /home/orchestra/.ssh/authorized_keys
exit
```

What `adduser` asks: `New password:` and `Retype new password:` (type a password for
the new account and remember it: `sudo` asks for it later; nothing shows while you
type), then `Full Name []:`, `Room Number []:` and a few more (press Enter for each),
then `Is the information correct? [Y/n]` (press Enter). The other lines print nothing
when they work. `exit` logs you out of the server.

Logged in as root with a password rather than a key? Then `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` does
not exist and the `cp` line fails. Run only `adduser` and `usermod`, `exit`, and then, from your
own computer, `ssh-copy-id orchestra@<server ip>` (it asks for the new user's password once).

Then, from your own computer: `ssh orchestra@<your server address>` (the same address you
used for `root@`). Check: `whoami` prints `orchestra`, and `sudo -v` asks for that user's
password (`[sudo] password for orchestra:`) and then prints nothing, which means it worked. If your provider already
logs you in as a normal user with sudo, skip this step.

### Tailscale on the VPS and on your own device

Tailscale puts the VPS and your own laptop or phone on a private network (a
"tailnet") that only your devices can join. It is how you will open the dashboard
in your browser over https without putting it on the public internet. The free
personal plan is enough.

On the VPS, as your normal user:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh   # downloads and installs Tailscale; ends with "Installation complete!"
sudo tailscale up                       # prints a login URL: open it in your browser and sign in
sudo tailscale set --operator=$USER     # lets your user run `tailscale serve` without sudo (step 2); prints nothing
tailscale status                        # the VPS is listed, with a 100.x.y.z address
```

`sudo tailscale up` prints `To authenticate, visit:` and a link. Select the link, copy it
(`Cmd+C` on a Mac, `Ctrl+C` in Windows Terminal, `Ctrl+Shift+C` on Linux), and open it in
your own computer's browser. Sign in or create a
Tailscale account (it signs you in with an existing Google, Microsoft, GitHub or Apple account) and approve the
device. The command on the server then finishes by itself. Remember which account you
used: your computer and phone must sign in with the same one.

On your own computer and/or phone: install Tailscale and sign in **with the same account**.
- **Mac:** **Tailscale** from the Mac App Store (or tailscale.com/download); open it and click
  its icon in the menu bar, top right of the screen, to log in.
- **Windows:** the installer from tailscale.com/download; after installing, click the
  Tailscale icon in the taskbar's notification area (bottom right) to log in.
- **Linux:** the commands at tailscale.com/download, then `sudo tailscale up`.
- **Phone:** the **Tailscale** app from the App Store or Google Play. Run `tailscale status` on
the VPS again: your device is now listed too.

Check: on the VPS, `tailscale ip -4` prints its tailnet address (it starts with `100.`).
From your laptop, `ping <that address>` answers (`Ctrl-C` stops it). From now on
you can `ssh <your user>@<that address>` instead of the public IP.

### Packages

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git tmux python3 python3-venv build-essential curl iproute2   # iproute2 = `ss`, which `orchestra doctor` needs to attribute ports to its own supervisor
# build-essential + python3 are not optional: node-pty (the web terminal's native addon) compiles at `npm install`;
# without them the install used to finish green with the terminal dead. `orchestra doctor` now shows a red
# `terminal:node-pty` row in that state; remedy: `npm rebuild node-pty` after installing the toolchain.
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt install -y nodejs
node -v                      # checks that Node is installed
```

What these do: the first line installs the tools OrchestraOS needs (git, tmux, Python and
a compiler); the `curl` line installs Node.js 22, which runs the dashboard and Claude Code.

You should see: each of the two long lines prints hundreds of lines and takes a minute or
two. They end with lines like `No VM guests are running outdated hypervisor (qemu)
binaries on this host.` If a coloured box asks which services to restart, press Enter.
`node -v` then prints a version starting with `v22`, for example `v22.23.3`.

Then install ONE agent CLI, pinned (next section), and log in to it (the section
after).

### Pin the agent CLI version

The harness reads the CLI's screen, transcripts, and hook events. It does not heal itself yet when
the CLI changes shape under it, so pin the CLI to a version this release was proven on and turn the
auto-updater off. Two versions are known good, both measured on 2026-09-19: the release gate ran on
**Claude Code 2.1.276** in the Docker image, and the reference fleet runs **2.1.260**. An unpinned
native install moved from 2.1.263 to 2.1.278 in one morning with no action from the operator.

```bash
sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.276
echo 'export DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1' >> ~/.bashrc && export DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1   # every seat's shell inherits it
claude --version                 # must print 2.1.276
```

You should see: the install prints `added 2 packages in 6s` (the time varies). It may also
print a few `npm notice` lines saying a newer npm is available; ignore them, and do not
update npm. The `echo` line prints nothing. `claude --version` prints `2.1.276 (Claude Code)`.

Why `sudo`: the Node above is a system-wide install, so global npm packages go to
`/usr/lib/node_modules`, which is owned by root. Without `sudo` the install fails with
`EACCES: permission denied` for a normal user. Do not work around that by pointing npm at a
prefix in your home directory: a prefix you own is one the CLI's auto-updater can write to,
and it can then move you off the pinned version. With the root-owned install the pin holds
even if `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` is ever missing from a shell; the updater just reports
`Auto-update failed: no write permission to npm prefix`, which is harmless. To change versions
later, run the same `sudo npm install -g` line with the new version.

If you installed Claude Code with the native installer instead of npm, it auto-updates; switch to the
npm install above for any machine that runs seats. For the Docker image, pass the pin as the build
argument: `--build-arg AGENT_CLIS="@anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.276"`. Without it the image pulls
whatever is current at build time, and inside the container auto-update is attempted every session
and fails with `Auto-update failed: no write permission to npm prefix` because the npm prefix is not
writable by the container user. That footer is not a fault in your setup; the pin and the export make
it go away. Gemini and Codex CLIs: pin the same way with their package managers (`sudo npm install -g` for
an npm package; the reference fleet runs agy 1.2.6 and codex-cli 0.153.4).

### Log in to the agent CLI (the one step only you can do)

This is the only step that needs a person: you sign in with your own account. Use
your own login; never copy someone else's credentials onto the server.

**You need a paid plan.** For Claude Code that is a Claude **Pro** or **Max** subscription
(claude.com/pricing; [docs/COSTS.md](/docs/costs/) compares the options). Buy it first, with the same
email you will sign in with.

On the server, start Claude Code once:

```bash
claude
```

It shows a few screens. The server has no browser, so you sign in from your own computer's browser:

1. **`Choose the text style that looks best with your terminal`**: a list of themes, with
   one marked `❯`. Press Enter to keep it (you can change it later with `/theme`).
2. **`Select login method:`** The first option is selected:
   `1. Claude account with subscription · Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise`. Press Enter.
3. **`Browser didn't open? Use the url below to sign in`**, then a very long link that wraps
   over several lines, then `Paste code here if prompted >`. With the mouse, select the
   whole link, from `https://` to its last character on the last line, copy it, and open it in
   your own computer's browser. Sign in, and click to authorize Claude Code.
4. The browser then shows a **code**. Copy it, go back to your terminal, paste it after
   `Paste code here if prompted >`, and press Enter.
5. A few more screens follow (a login confirmation and some notes). Press Enter on each.
   If it asks whether you trust the files in this folder, choose the option that says yes.
6. You are now in Claude Code's own prompt. Type `/exit` and press Enter to leave it.
   Your login is saved.

Check that the login stuck:

```bash
claude auth status
```

You should see: a few lines of text that include `"loggedIn": true` and a
`"subscriptionType"` naming your plan. `"loggedIn": false` means the login did not
finish: run `claude` again.

For the other CLIs:

| runtime | binary | run once | check |
|---|---|---|---|
| claude | `claude` | `claude` | `claude auth status` reports `loggedIn: true` |
| gemini | `agy`    | `agy` | `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/antigravity-oauth-token` exists |
| codex  | `codex`  | `codex login` | `~/.codex/auth.json` has a `tokens` key |

Do this before step 1. (You can log in later, but until you do, `orchestra doctor` reports
`runtime:login` as `MISSING`.) `orchestra spawn` (step 3) checks first: with no enabled CLI
installed and logged in, it refuses with `refusing to spawn: no enabled runtime is
installed AND logged in` and exits 2. The low-level `./spawn-agent.sh` does not check:
a seat it launches against a CLI you have not logged in to retries, prints
`Injection FAILED`, and exits, while the CLI's own sign-in screen waits unread in the
seat's terminal.

## 1. Clone, init, doctor

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tulum-DAO/orchestraos.git orchestraos && cd orchestraos
make install                 # symlinks bin/orchestra into ~/.local/bin
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
grep -q 'HOME/.local/bin' ~/.bashrc || echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
orchestra init --yes         # data dir (~/.orchestra), orchestra.toml, .venv + pip, npm install, builds.
                             #   Takes about 5 minutes on a small VPS (the dashboard build); it is not hung.
                             #   --yes writes the Claude Code hook rows into ~/.claude/settings.json (see below)
                             #   mic dictation works in every browser out of the box (~99 MB model, background);
                             #   --stt adds the better faster-whisper engine (+~500 MB, see docs/ARTURO.md)
sed -i '/^\[runtimes\]/,/^\[/ s/^enabled = .*/enabled = ["claude"]/' orchestra.toml   # the CLI you logged in to
orchestra doctor             # every row OK (WARN/INFO rows are advisory); exit code 0
```

What these do: `git clone` downloads OrchestraOS into a folder called `orchestraos` and
`cd` moves you into it; `make install` and the two PATH lines make the `orchestra` command
available; `orchestra init --yes` sets everything up; the `sed` line tells OrchestraOS which
agent CLI you use; `orchestra doctor` checks the result.

You should see:

- `git clone`: progress lines ending with `Resolving deltas: 100% (...), done.`
- `make install`: `installed /home/<you>/.local/bin/orchestra`, then a `NOTE` that
  `orchestra` is not on your PATH yet. The two PATH lines right after it fix that; they
  print nothing.
- `orchestra init --yes`: about five minutes of output, ending with a table whose rows
  say `did` (or `skipped` on a re-run), then `next:     orchestra doctor && orchestra up`.
- `sed`: nothing.
- `orchestra doctor`: a table with one row per check (`CHECK`, `STATUS`, `DETAIL`), ending
  with `doctor: all required checks OK`. `WARN` and `INFO` rows are advice, not failures.

Not logged in to the CLI yet? Then `runtime:login` is the one `MISSING` row (a few rows
marked `MISSING*` go away with it) and the last line is `doctor: 1 required check(s)
MISSING`. Log in (§0, "Log in to the agent CLI") and run `orchestra doctor` again.

The two PATH lines matter: `~/.local/bin` only joins your PATH at **login**, and only if it
already existed then. On a clean machine it did not, so without them a bare `orchestra` right after
`make install` answers `command not found`. With them, `orchestra` works in this shell and in every
later one; `./bin/orchestra` from the checkout always works too.

The `sed` line sets the `enabled = [...]` line **under `[runtimes]`** to the one CLI you logged in
to. Use `["gemini"]` or `["codex"]` if that is your CLI. `orchestra.toml` has other `enabled =`
lines (`[arturo]`, `[telemetry]`, `[plugins.*]`); leave those alone. To edit by hand instead:
`$EDITOR orchestra.toml`, find `[runtimes]`, and change the `enabled` line just below it.

`orchestra init` is idempotent: it never overwrites `orchestra.toml`, skips what
exists, and prints did/skipped per step. `--data-dir PATH` moves state elsewhere
(so does `ORCHESTRA_DIR=PATH` in the environment: flag > `ORCHESTRA_DIR` > `[data] dir`
in orchestra.toml > `~/.orchestra`, and the default `~/.orchestra` is never touched when
the env names another dir); `--no-npm` / `--no-venv` / `--no-build` skip the slow steps.

The last step writes hook rows into your Claude Code settings
(`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/settings.json`, default `~/.claude/settings.json`) — a file every
Claude session on the machine reads. init prints exactly the rows it will add and asks
`y/N`; `--yes` (or `ORCHESTRA_YES=1`) answers yes, and a non-interactive run without it
SKIPS the hooks and says so (unattended installs: `orchestra init --yes`;
`ORCHESTRA_SKIP_HOOKS=1` for a container that runs no Claude seats).

Want gm on your phone? [`plugins/telegram/README.md`](https://github.com/Tulum-DAO/orchestraos/blob/3dbe1a3f873d2127a612623b525d05b23e071d77/docs/plugins/telegram/README.md) — a BotFather token in
`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `[plugins.telegram] enabled = true`, and `orchestra up` runs the
channel: texts land in gm's inbox, decision cards arrive with buttons.

If you don't want the voice brain, set `[arturo] enabled = false` — the flask/openai
rows in doctor become INFO and `orchestra up` skips it.

## 2. Up

```bash
orchestra up --detach && orchestra status   # starts everything in the background, then shows what is running
```

You should see: `supervisor started in background (pid …)`, then `supervisor: running pid …`,
then one line per part (`gateway`, `api`, `dashboard`, the beats) with its status. It keeps
running after you log out. `orchestra down` stops it. (`orchestra up` without `--detach` runs
in the foreground instead, and `Ctrl-C` stops it.)

One supervisor process runs, restarts (with backoff) and logs each child under
`<data>/logs/<name>.log`:

| name | what | port / cadence (orchestra.toml) |
|---|---|---|
| gateway | `scripts/watch_gateway.py` — approvals + verified inject | `[gateway] port` (8890) |
| api | `api/dist/server.js` | `[api] port` (8888) |
| dashboard | `dashboard-proxy.js` — static UI, `/api` proxy, web terminal | `[dashboard] port` (8891) |
| arturo | `services/arturo/run.sh` (optional) | `[arturo] port` (5071) |
| bus_beat | event-bus drain | every `bus_beat_interval_seconds` (60) |
| boundary_delivery | turn-boundary delivery, armed | every 60 s (`boundary_delivery_armed`) |
| cron_beat | autonomous blue-green rotation beat — ON by default | every `cron_beat_interval_seconds` (900) |
| router | `scripts/message-router.py --cron` delivery backstop | `[router] interval_seconds` (60) |
| approval_resume | `approval_resume.py` — delivers an answered card to its seat (pane inject + msg_store row) | every 60 s |
| telemetryd | `lineage_daemon.telemetryd` — works out which seats are working or idle, for the Agents page and the router. Local only: it reads the seats' terminal output and `/proc` and writes a status file under `<data>/realtime`; nothing is sent anywhere | `[telemetry] enabled` (on) |
| menu_bridge | `scripts/menu_bridge.py` — turns a question menu inside a seat into a decision card, and types your answer back | every 60 s (`[menus] bridge_enabled`) |
| telegram | `plugins/telegram/router.py` (optional) | off unless `[plugins.telegram] enabled` and `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` |

No crontab is installed. `orchestra up --dry-run` prints this table without
starting anything. `orchestra down` stops it; `orchestra status` shows pids.

Smoke check: `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/health` → `{"status":"ok", "db":{"open":true}, ...}`
(`orchestra doctor` runs the same probe as `api:health` while the supervisor is up).

### Open the dashboard in your browser, over Tailscale https

The dashboard listens on `127.0.0.1:8891` on the VPS, so it is not reachable from
outside the machine. `tailscale serve` gives it an https address that only devices
on your tailnet can open.

**Keep it tailnet only.** The dashboard has no login of its own, and its web terminal
types into your seats' terminals on the server. Anyone who can open it can run
commands as your user. So: never `--funnel` (that publishes it to the whole internet),
never `[dashboard] host = "0.0.0.0"` on a VPS, and share your tailnet only with people
you would give a shell to. The web terminal also refuses on purpose to connect when the
dashboard is opened by a raw IP address (e.g. `http://203.0.113.5:8891`), so a
`0.0.0.0` bind gets you a dashboard whose terminal does not work.

First see what Tailscale already serves on this machine. `tailscale serve` on an https
port that is already taken silently replaces whatever was there:

```bash
tailscale serve status        # on a fresh VPS: "No serve config"
```

Pick an https port that is not in that list. On a fresh VPS nothing is, so use 443,
which gives an address with no port number in it. The target is the dashboard's plain
http address (`[dashboard] port`, default 8891; `orchestra status` prints it):

```bash
tailscale serve --bg --https=443 http://127.0.0.1:8891
tailscale serve status        # prints the address, e.g. https://<vps>.<tailnet>.ts.net
```

If 443 was taken, use another free port, e.g. `--https=8446`; the address then ends
in `:8446`. The first time, Tailscale may answer that serve or https certificates
are not enabled on your tailnet and print an admin link: open it, enable them, and
run the command again.

Open that address in a browser on your laptop or phone (it must be signed in to
Tailscale). The dashboard loads, with an empty Agents list until step 3. The first
visit can take a few seconds while the certificate is issued. Optional: put the
address in `orchestra.toml` as `[public] host` so links in the UI and notifications
point at it.

`tailscale serve` keeps this setting across reboots. `tailscale serve --https=443 off`
removes it.

The web terminal only accepts connections from the address the dashboard was opened at,
and it knows three kinds: loopback (`127.0.0.1`), the `[dashboard] host` you set, and
Tailscale names (`*.ts.net`). If you put the dashboard behind your own reverse proxy or
domain instead, list that name in `ORCHESTRA_DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (comma-separated)
in the shell that runs `orchestra up`, then restart it, e.g.
`export ORCHESTRA_DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_HOSTS=dash.example.org`. Otherwise the dashboard loads
but its terminal fails to connect, and `<data>/logs/dashboard.log` shows
`[ws] refused ... (host-not-served)`.

No Tailscale? From your laptop, `ssh -L 8891:127.0.0.1:8891 <user>@<server>` and then
open `http://127.0.0.1:8891` while that ssh session stays open.

## 3. Spawn one seat

The one-command way: `orchestra spawn` registers the seat in the data-dir registry (if it is
new) and launches it in tmux with the install env carried into the pane.

```bash
orchestra spawn gm --gm                  # the General Manager: prompts/gm.md, tier T0, always-on
orchestra spawn hello --task "Say hello, then park."   # a worker seat (prompts/hello.md if present)
orchestra agent create dev-x --template dev --parent pm-y --set PROJECT=demo   # advanced, skip on a first install: fill the role template (refuses an unfilled {TOKEN}), record the parent, validate runtime/model, spawn, verify ALIVE
tmux attach -t gm                        # talk to it; detach with Ctrl-B D
```

On a first install, the first two lines are all you need.

**Talking to a seat.** Each seat runs in its own terminal session on the server, kept alive by
tmux, so it keeps working when you close the terminal on your own computer. `tmux attach -t gm` shows you
the `gm` seat's screen: type to it like a chat and press Enter. To leave without stopping it,
**detach**: press `Ctrl-B`, let go, then press `D`. You are back at your own prompt, and the
seat keeps running. (Closing the Terminal window also leaves it running.) `tmux ls` lists the
sessions. You can also talk to seats from the dashboard in your browser.

The new seat appears in the dashboard's Agents list in your browser within about 15 seconds.

Options: `--runtime claude|gemini|codex` (default: first of `[runtimes] enabled`), `--model`,
`--tier`, `--prompt path/relative/to/checkout`. An existing registry row is kept as-is.

Mail a seat and watch it act with no keypress (the shipped hooks + the router beat under
`orchestra up`; see docs/HOOKS.md):

```bash
source scripts/orchestra-env.sh      # once per shell: tells msg_store.py and the scripts where your data dir is
echo "hello" > note.txt
python3 msg_store.py send --from you --to gm --subject hi --body-file note.txt
```

The lower-level pieces are still there (but a seat made this way has no lineage and
cannot be rotated — use `orchestra spawn` for anything you will rotate): `scripts/registry-update.py` writes the row,
`./spawn-agent.sh <seat> --task ...` launches an already-registered seat, `--list` / `--running`
show registered and live seats.

- `machine` is a label. On a single-machine install (`[machines]` left blank in
  `orchestra.toml`) the spawner never dispatches elsewhere.
- The spawner pre-seeds Claude Code's workspace-trust bit and the bypass-permissions
  acceptance for `cwd` (`scripts/ensure_cwd_trusted.py`; honors `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`), so the
  seat does not stop at a first-run dialog. If you see one anyway, answer it once in `tmux attach`.

Verify through the dashboard proxy (the same list the UI shows):

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8891/api/agents | python3 -m json.tool | grep -E '"id"|"alive"|"state"'
```

The `hello` row appears immediately; `alive`/`state` follow within ~15 s from the
status detector. Only registered seats are listed — tmux is host-global, see "Sharing a
host" below.

## 4. Answer one approval card from the dashboard

From a shell (or let the seat run it):

```bash
source scripts/orchestra-env.sh      # already done in §3 if you are in the same shell; harmless to repeat
python3 scripts/approval.py request "Ship the hello change?" --from hello --worker-kind pane --options approve,deny
# -> prints the card id, e.g. apr_1a2b3c4d_567
```

On a minimum install it also prints two warnings: an `authorship-guard` note (`no caller
signal ... fail-open`, because you ran it from a plain shell, not a seat) and one about
ntfy push (no push is set up on the minimum path). Both are normal; the card is created.

The card appears under Approvals in the dashboard (`GET /api/approvals` through the
proxy lists it under `pending`); answer it there, or from a shell:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8891/api/approvals/<card id>/approve
```

What happens next, and how to see it:

1. The answer is recorded in `<data>/state/tasks.db` (`python3 scripts/approval.py get <card id>`
   shows `status: answered`).
2. Within a minute the `approval_resume` beat (see the `orchestra up` table) delivers it:
   because the card came `--from hello --worker-kind pane`, the decision is typed into the
   `hello` tmux pane as a message and a durable row is written for the seat
   (`python3 msg_store.py inbox --agent hello`). `approval.py get` then shows
   `status: resumed`; `tmux capture-pane -p -t hello | tail -20` shows the delivered
   decision; `<data>/logs/approval_resume.log` has the delivery line.
3. `GET /api/approvals` keeps the card out of `pending` from the moment it is answered.

A card requested from an ambient shell behaves exactly like one a seat requested for
itself: the seat named in `--from` is the one that receives the answer.

## 5. Rotate a seat (manual, lossless)

A seat near its context ceiling banks a handoff (its prompt knows the format:
`<data>/docs/HANDOFF_<seat>-next.md` with a `## canary_questions` block anchored in its own
state). Then:

```bash
orchestra rotate gm --dry-run            # preconditions only
orchestra rotate gm                      # spawn successor -> it authors a readback -> strict grade -> promote
orchestra rotate hello --synthesize      # a seat that never banked: minimal baton (sid, ports, last mail ids)
orchestra rotate gm --resume             # a held attempt whose successor pane is still up
```

What "lossless" means here: the successor answers the canary questions from the handoff and
the repo alone; a generic readback HOLDs (predecessor keeps the seat, nothing is renamed). On
PASS the readback is committed in the data-dir repo (`orchestra init` made it one), the
registry flips to the new generation, the old pane is kept as `<seat>-gen<N>` for one
generation, and the successor gets its promotion prompt. Verify by effect:

```bash
python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('$ORCHESTRA_DIR/registry.json'))['agents']['gm'])"
tmux ls | grep gm
```

## 6. Check the rotation beat is armed (default ON)

`orchestra doctor` rows `rotation:beat` (armed, cadence, e-brake) and
`rotation:seats` (which T2 claude seats are eligible; the
`<runtime_dir>/self_retire_armed` allowlist — one lineage root per line — enables
hard rotation for a seat). E-brake: `touch ~/runtime/FLEET_BEAT_DISABLED`.

## Dev container / Docker (no VPS)

The repo ships a `Dockerfile` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` that reproduce the
clean-machine recipe the B1 walkthroughs were proven on (ubuntu 24.04, non-root user
with sudo, §0 prerequisites, node 22, the Claude CLI preinstalled). `orchestra init`
runs at image build time, so `doctor` is instant on first open.

```bash
docker build -t orchestraos .
docker run -it --rm -p 8891:8891 -p 8888:8888 -p 8890:8890 orchestraos
# NOTE: those -p publishes answer HTTP 000 until you add a relay — the services bind 127.0.0.1
# inside the container. See "Running inside Docker: the services bind loopback" below.
# inside:  claude            # log in ONCE — your login, never baked into the image
#          orchestra doctor  # all required rows OK
#          orchestra up      # then open http://127.0.0.1:8891 on the laptop
```

- The login is yours: the image contains no credentials. To keep it across containers,
  mount your CLI config: `-v ~/.claude:/home/orchestra/.claude`. The dev container does
  that mount for you and keeps the data dir in a named volume (`orchestraos-data`).
- VS Code / GitHub Codespaces: "Reopen in Container". The workspace is bind-mounted over
  the image's copy, so `postCreateCommand` re-runs `orchestra init` once (~1 min) to
  rebuild `.venv` and `node_modules` for the mounted tree.
- Other CLIs: `docker build --build-arg AGENT_CLIS="@anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.276 @openai/codex"` (pin the version; see "Pin the agent CLI version" above).
- The container is one instance on one host: tmux inside it is its own, so the
  registry-scoping rules below apply per container.

### Machine image (VPS snapshot) — 20-minute job once the provider is chosen

Same recipe, no Docker: on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VPS as a non-root sudo user, run the
`RUN` steps of the `Dockerfile` in order (§0 prerequisites, node 22, `sudo npm i -g
@anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.276`, clone, `make install`, `orchestra init`), leave the agent CLI
logged OUT, then snapshot. A team booting the snapshot logs in, edits `[runtimes]
enabled`, and runs `orchestra doctor && orchestra up --detach`. Pre-provision one snapshot
per team (P5).

## Sharing a host with other tmux sessions

tmux is host-global. The dashboard's agent list, `agent-status.py --all` and the
rotation beat are **registry-scoped**: they only see sessions that resolve to a seat in
`<data>/registry.json` (its id or its `tmux_session`). `orchestra doctor` warns
(`tmux:foreign-sessions`) about the sessions it is ignoring. Set `[dashboard]
show_unregistered_sessions = true` to list them anyway; `agent-status.py --all
--all-sessions` is the host-wide escape hatch. One instance per host is still the
simplest setup.

## Where things live

- config: `orchestra.toml` (or `$ORCHESTRA_CONFIG`) — every key documented in `orchestra.example.toml`; secrets only via env
- data: `[data] dir` → `registry.json`, `state/` (sqlite, sessions, gateway token), `logs/`, `queue/`
- code: the checkout; `ORCHESTRA_ROOT` / `PYTHONPATH` are exported to every child by the supervisor

## Running inside Docker: the services bind loopback

Every service (`gateway`, `api`, `dashboard`, `arturo`) binds `127.0.0.1` by default
(`orchestra.toml` `[gateway] host`, `dashboard-proxy.js` `ORCHESTRA_DASHBOARD_HOST`). A Docker
`-p` published port therefore answers **HTTP 000** even on a fully-up container — measured on the
release image 2026-09-19: inside the container the dashboard answered 200, the published host
port answered nothing. Until the bind is configurable (post-release), publish through a small
in-container relay that listens on `0.0.0.0` and forwards to `127.0.0.1:8891`, and point your
`ssh -L` / browser at the relay's port. Inside the container:

```bash
sudo apt install -y socat
socat TCP-LISTEN:18891,fork,reuseaddr TCP:127.0.0.1:8891 &
```

Then publish `-p 8891:18891` instead of `-p 8891:8891`; any TCP forwarder does the same job.

## Reference install (the operator's own setup: VPS + Mac over Tailscale, ntfy, Telegram, voice)

Not needed for the minimum path. See `orchestra.example.toml` `[machines]`,
`[notify]` and `services/arturo/run.sh` for the knobs; a step-by-step is tracked as
checklist item B2.
