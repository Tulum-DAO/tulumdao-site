One machine, one CLI (claude OR gemini OR codex), no voice, no Telegram.
Target: gateway up, one seat spawned, one approval card answered from the web
dashboard, in under 30 minutes on a clean Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 VPS.

Once the gateway from step 2 below is up, connecting your own phone and
browser to it (no baked-in token) is [`docs/ONBOARDING.md`](/docs/onboarding/) — a separate
short walkthrough, not part of this doc's steps.

## 0. Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git tmux python3 python3-venv build-essential curl iproute2   # iproute2 = `ss`, which `orchestra doctor` needs to attribute ports to its own supervisor
# build-essential + python3 are not optional: node-pty (the web terminal's native addon) compiles at `npm install`;
# without them the install used to finish green with the terminal dead. `orchestra doctor` now shows a red
# `terminal:node-pty` row in that state; remedy: `npm rebuild node-pty` after installing the toolchain.
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

Install and log in to ONE agent CLI (the runtime catalog probes these):

| runtime | binary | login |
|---|---|---|
| claude | `claude` | run `claude`, complete the login; `claude auth status` must report `loggedIn: true` |
| gemini | `agy`    | run `agy` once; token lands in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/antigravity-oauth-token` |
| codex  | `codex`  | run `codex login`; `~/.codex/auth.json` gets a `tokens` key |

### Pin the agent CLI version

The harness reads the CLI's screen, transcripts, and hook events. It does not heal itself yet when
the CLI changes shape under it, so pin the CLI to a version this release was proven on and turn the
auto-updater off. Two versions are known good, both measured on 2026-09-19: the release gate ran on
**Claude Code 2.1.276** in the Docker image, and the reference fleet runs **2.1.260**. An unpinned
native install moved from 2.1.263 to 2.1.278 in one morning with no action from the operator.

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.276
export DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1     # put it in your shell profile so every seat inherits it
claude --version                 # must print 2.1.276
```

If you installed Claude Code with the native installer instead of npm, it auto-updates; switch to the
npm install above for any machine that runs seats. For the Docker image, pass the pin as the build
argument: `--build-arg AGENT_CLIS="@anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.276"`. Without it the image pulls
whatever is current at build time, and inside the container auto-update is attempted every session
and fails with `Auto-update failed: no write permission to npm prefix` because the npm prefix is not
writable by the container user. That footer is not a fault in your setup; the pin and the export make
it go away. Gemini and Codex CLIs: pin the same way with their package managers (the reference fleet
runs agy 1.2.6 and codex-cli 0.153.4).

## 1. Clone, init, doctor

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tulum-DAO/orchestraos.git orchestraos && cd orchestraos
make install                 # symlinks bin/orchestra into ~/.local/bin
./bin/orchestra init         # data dir (~/.orchestra), orchestra.toml, .venv + pip, npm install, builds;
                             #   mic dictation works in every browser out of the box (~99 MB model, background);
                             #   --stt adds the better faster-whisper engine (+~500 MB, see docs/ARTURO.md)
                             # shows the Claude hook rows it will add to ~/.claude/settings.json and asks (or --yes)
$EDITOR orchestra.toml       # set [runtimes] enabled to the CLI you logged in to, e.g. ["claude"]
./bin/orchestra doctor       # every row OK (WARN/INFO rows are advisory); exit code 0
```

`./bin/orchestra` is spelled out above because `~/.local/bin` only joins your PATH at **login**, and
only if it already existed then — on a clean machine it did not, so a bare `orchestra` in the same
shell as `make install` answers `command not found`. `make install` prints the `export PATH=...` line
when that applies; run it (and add it to `~/.bashrc`) to use the bare `orchestra` everywhere.

`orchestra init` is idempotent: it never overwrites `orchestra.toml`, skips what
exists, and prints did/skipped per step. `--data-dir PATH` moves state elsewhere
(so does `ORCHESTRA_DIR=PATH` in the environment: flag > `ORCHESTRA_DIR` > `[data] dir`
in orchestra.toml > `~/.orchestra`, and the default `~/.orchestra` is never touched when
the env names another dir); `--no-npm` / `--no-venv` / `--no-build` skip the slow steps.

The last step writes hook rows into your Claude Code settings
(`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/settings.json`, default `~/.claude/settings.json`) — a file every
Claude session on the machine reads. init prints exactly the rows it will add and asks
`y/N`; `--yes` (or `ORCHESTRA_YES=1`) answers yes, and a non-interactive run without it
SKIPS the hooks and says so (unattended installs: `orchestra init --yes`;
`ORCHESTRA_SKIP_HOOKS=1` for a container that runs no Claude seats).

Want gm on your phone? [`plugins/telegram/README.md`](https://github.com/Tulum-DAO/orchestraos/blob/0f4fe490ba840a52bd83c4e5b6d4f6a7646b13f7/docs/plugins/telegram/README.md) — a BotFather token in
`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `[plugins.telegram] enabled = true`, and `orchestra up` runs the
channel: texts land in gm's inbox, decision cards arrive with buttons.

If you don't want the voice brain, set `[arturo] enabled = false` — the flask/openai
rows in doctor become INFO and `orchestra up` skips it.

## 2. Up

```bash
orchestra up                 # foreground; Ctrl-C stops everything
# or
orchestra up --detach && orchestra status
```

One supervisor process runs, restarts (with backoff) and logs each child under
`<data>/logs/<name>.log`:

| name | what | port / cadence (orchestra.toml) |
|---|---|---|
| gateway | `scripts/watch_gateway.py` — approvals + verified inject | `[gateway] port` (8890) |
| api | `api/dist/server.js` | `[api] port` (8888) |
| dashboard | `dashboard-proxy.js` — static UI, `/api` proxy, web terminal | `[dashboard] port` (8891) |
| arturo | `services/arturo/run.sh` (optional) | `[arturo] port` (5071) |
| bus_beat | event-bus drain | every `bus_beat_interval_seconds` (60) |
| boundary_delivery | turn-boundary delivery, armed | every 60 s (`boundary_delivery_armed`) |
| cron_beat | autonomous blue-green rotation beat — ON by default | every `cron_beat_interval_seconds` (900) |
| router | `message-router.py --cron` delivery backstop | `[router] interval_seconds` (60) |
| approval_resume | `approval_resume.py` — delivers an answered card to its seat (pane inject + msg_store row) | every 60 s |

No crontab is installed. `orchestra up --dry-run` prints this table without
starting anything. `orchestra down` stops it; `orchestra status` shows pids.

Smoke check: `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/health` → `{"status":"ok", "db":{"open":true}, ...}`
(`orchestra doctor` runs the same probe as `api:health` while the supervisor is up).

Open the dashboard: `http://127.0.0.1:8891` (ssh -L 8891:127.0.0.1:8891 if remote,
or set `[dashboard] host` / `[public] host`).

## 3. Spawn one seat

The one-command way: `orchestra spawn` registers the seat in the data-dir registry (if it is
new) and launches it in tmux with the install env carried into the pane.

```bash
orchestra spawn gm --gm                  # the General Manager: prompts/gm.md, tier T0, always-on
orchestra spawn hello --task "Say hello, then park."   # a worker seat (prompts/hello.md if present)
orchestra agent create dev-x --template dev --parent pm-y --set PROJECT=demo   # one verb: fill the role template (refuses an unfilled {TOKEN}), record the parent, validate runtime/model, spawn, verify ALIVE
tmux attach -t gm                        # talk to it; detach with Ctrl-B D
```

Options: `--runtime claude|gemini|codex` (default: first of `[runtimes] enabled`), `--model`,
`--tier`, `--prompt path/relative/to/checkout`. An existing registry row is kept as-is.

Mail a seat and watch it act with no keypress (the shipped hooks + the router beat under
`orchestra up`; see docs/HOOKS.md):

```bash
python3 msg_store.py send --from you --to gm --subject hi --body-file note.txt
```

The lower-level pieces are still there (but a seat made this way has no lineage and
cannot be rotated — use `orchestra spawn` for anything you will rotate): `scripts/registry-update.py` writes the row,
`./spawn-agent.sh <seat> --task ...` launches an already-registered seat, `--list` / `--running`
show registered and live seats.

- `machine` is a label. On a single-machine install (`[machines]` left blank in
  `orchestra.toml`) the spawner never dispatches elsewhere.
- The spawner pre-seeds Claude Code's workspace-trust bit and the bypass-permissions
  acceptance for `cwd` (`scripts/ensure_cwd_trusted.py`; honors `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`), so the
  seat does not stop at a first-run dialog. If you see one anyway, answer it once in `tmux attach`.

Verify through the dashboard proxy (the same list the UI shows):

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8891/api/agents | python3 -m json.tool | grep -E '"id"|"alive"|"state"'
```

The `hello` row appears immediately; `alive`/`state` follow within ~15 s from the
status detector. Only registered seats are listed — tmux is host-global, see "Sharing a
host" below.

## 4. Answer one approval card from the dashboard

From a shell (or let the seat run it):

```bash
source scripts/orchestra-env.sh
python3 scripts/approval.py request "Ship the hello change?" --from hello --worker-kind pane --options approve,deny
# -> prints the card id, e.g. apr_1a2b3c4d_567
```

The card appears under Approvals in the dashboard (`GET /api/approvals` through the
proxy lists it under `pending`); answer it there, or from a shell:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8891/api/approvals/<card id>/approve
```

What happens next, and how to see it:

1. The answer is recorded in `<data>/state/tasks.db` (`python3 scripts/approval.py get <card id>`
   shows `status: answered`).
2. Within a minute the `approval_resume` beat (see the `orchestra up` table) delivers it:
   because the card came `--from hello --worker-kind pane`, the decision is typed into the
   `hello` tmux pane as a message and a durable row is written for the seat
   (`python3 msg_store.py inbox --agent hello`). `approval.py get` then shows
   `status: resumed`; `tmux capture-pane -p -t hello | tail -20` shows the delivered
   decision; `<data>/logs/approval_resume.log` has the delivery line.
3. `GET /api/approvals` keeps the card out of `pending` from the moment it is answered.

A card requested from an ambient shell behaves exactly like one a seat requested for
itself: the seat named in `--from` is the one that receives the answer.

## 5. Rotate a seat (manual, lossless)

A seat near its context ceiling banks a handoff (its prompt knows the format:
`<data>/docs/HANDOFF_<seat>-next.md` with a `## canary_questions` block anchored in its own
state). Then:

```bash
orchestra rotate gm --dry-run            # preconditions only
orchestra rotate gm                      # spawn successor -> it authors a readback -> strict grade -> promote
orchestra rotate hello --synthesize      # a seat that never banked: minimal baton (sid, ports, last mail ids)
orchestra rotate gm --resume             # a held attempt whose successor pane is still up
```

What "lossless" means here: the successor answers the canary questions from the handoff and
the repo alone; a generic readback HOLDs (predecessor keeps the seat, nothing is renamed). On
PASS the readback is committed in the data-dir repo (`orchestra init` made it one), the
registry flips to the new generation, the old pane is kept as `<seat>-gen<N>` for one
generation, and the successor gets its promotion prompt. Verify by effect:

```bash
python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('$ORCHESTRA_DIR/registry.json'))['agents']['gm'])"
tmux ls | grep gm
```

## 6. Check the rotation beat is armed (default ON)

`orchestra doctor` rows `rotation:beat` (armed, cadence, e-brake) and
`rotation:seats` (which T2 claude seats are eligible; the
`<runtime_dir>/self_retire_armed` allowlist — one lineage root per line — enables
hard rotation for a seat). E-brake: `touch ~/runtime/FLEET_BEAT_DISABLED`.

## Dev container / Docker (no VPS)

The repo ships a `Dockerfile` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` that reproduce the
clean-machine recipe the B1 walkthroughs were proven on (ubuntu 24.04, non-root user
with sudo, §0 prerequisites, node 22, the Claude CLI preinstalled). `orchestra init`
runs at image build time, so `doctor` is instant on first open.

```bash
docker build -t orchestraos .
docker run -it --rm -p 8891:8891 -p 8888:8888 -p 8890:8890 orchestraos
# NOTE: those -p publishes answer HTTP 000 until you add a relay — the services bind 127.0.0.1
# inside the container. See "Running inside Docker: the services bind loopback" below.
# inside:  claude            # log in ONCE — your login, never baked into the image
#          orchestra doctor  # all required rows OK
#          orchestra up      # then open http://127.0.0.1:8891 on the laptop
```

- The login is yours: the image contains no credentials. To keep it across containers,
  mount your CLI config: `-v ~/.claude:/home/orchestra/.claude`. The dev container does
  that mount for you and keeps the data dir in a named volume (`orchestraos-data`).
- VS Code / GitHub Codespaces: "Reopen in Container". The workspace is bind-mounted over
  the image's copy, so `postCreateCommand` re-runs `orchestra init` once (~1 min) to
  rebuild `.venv` and `node_modules` for the mounted tree.
- Other CLIs: `docker build --build-arg AGENT_CLIS="@anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.276 @openai/codex"` (pin the version; see "Pin the agent CLI version" above).
- The container is one instance on one host: tmux inside it is its own, so the
  registry-scoping rules below apply per container.

### Machine image (VPS snapshot) — 20-minute job once the provider is chosen

Same recipe, no Docker: on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VPS as a non-root sudo user, run the
`RUN` steps of the `Dockerfile` in order (§0 prerequisites, node 22, `npm i -g
@anthropic-ai/claude-code`, clone, `make install`, `orchestra init`), leave the agent CLI
logged OUT, then snapshot. A team booting the snapshot logs in, edits `[runtimes]
enabled`, and runs `orchestra doctor && orchestra up --detach`. Pre-provision one snapshot
per team (P5).

## Sharing a host with other tmux sessions

tmux is host-global. The dashboard's agent list, `agent-status.py --all` and the
rotation beat are **registry-scoped**: they only see sessions that resolve to a seat in
`<data>/registry.json` (its id or its `tmux_session`). `orchestra doctor` warns
(`tmux:foreign-sessions`) about the sessions it is ignoring. Set `[dashboard]
show_unregistered_sessions = true` to list them anyway; `agent-status.py --all
--all-sessions` is the host-wide escape hatch. One instance per host is still the
simplest setup.

## Where things live

- config: `orchestra.toml` (or `$ORCHESTRA_CONFIG`) — every key documented in `orchestra.example.toml`; secrets only via env
- data: `[data] dir` → `registry.json`, `state/` (sqlite, sessions, gateway token), `logs/`, `queue/`
- code: the checkout; `ORCHESTRA_ROOT` / `PYTHONPATH` are exported to every child by the supervisor

## Running inside Docker: the services bind loopback

Every service (`gateway`, `api`, `dashboard`, `arturo`) binds `127.0.0.1` by default
(`orchestra.toml` `[gateway] host`, `dashboard-proxy.js` `ORCHESTRA_DASHBOARD_HOST`). A Docker
`-p` published port therefore answers **HTTP 000** even on a fully-up container — measured on the
release image 2026-09-19: inside the container the dashboard answered 200, the published host
port answered nothing. Until the bind is configurable (post-release), publish through a small
in-container relay that listens on `0.0.0.0` and forwards to `127.0.0.1:8891`, and point your
`ssh -L` / browser at the relay's port. A one-file Python relay is in `scripts/build-demo-box.sh`
of the operator's reference install; any TCP forwarder (`socat TCP-LISTEN:18891,fork,reuseaddr
TCP:127.0.0.1:8891`) does the same job.

## Reference install (the operator's own setup: VPS + Mac over Tailscale, ntfy, Telegram, voice)

Not needed for the minimum path. See `orchestra.example.toml` `[machines]`,
`[notify]` and `services/arturo/run.sh` for the knobs; a step-by-step is tracked as
checklist item B2.
